The data comes from https://irma.nps.gov/NPSpecies/Search/SpeciesList.\n\nThe information in NPSpecies is available to the public.

Together they broke down barriers. They defeated evil by demonstrating teamwork, inclusivity, and diversity to people of all ages. Today, this grand tradition continues as new Ranger teams and new generations of fans discover these essential values again.\n\nThe series, created by Haim Saban, has one of the most popular taglines in history, “It’s Morphin Time!” The TV series “Mighty Morphin Power Rangers” (MMPR) launched on August 28, 1993. Power Rangers quickly became the #1 kids action brand and a global phenomenon. With its current 25th season, “Power Rangers Super Ninja Steel,” the show is now the second-longest-running, non-soap-opera, scripted program on American TV (after “The Simpsons”). There are also over 830 episodes in its library. Currently, Power Rangers is seen in more than 150 markets around the world. It’s also translated into numerous languages and is a favorite on many indispensable children’s programming blocks around the world.

The dataset lists the date, teams, score, attendance, division, tier, and season of each match, as well as each season’s final standings. Rob took inspiration from the Fjelstul English Football Database, a similarly structured dataset that covers men’s professional football since 1888.\n\nThe English Women’s Football (EWF) Database is an open database of matches played in the top tiers of women’s football in England. It covers all matches played since the 2011 season for the highest division (the Women’s Super League) and since the 2014 season for the second-highest division (the Women’s Championship).\n\nThe dataset contains three datasets:\n\newf_matches contains all matches that have been played and has one observation per match per season.\newf_appearances contains all appearances by a team and has one observation per team per match per season.\newf_standings contains all end-of-the-season division tables and has one observation per team per season.\n\n\nThe data in the English Women’s Football (EWF) Database has been collected from multiple online sources and has been cross-referenced to confirm its accuracy. Information in the database is also cross-referenced with itself to ensure consistency. For example, that a team’s goals_for at the end of the season in ewf_standings is equal to the number of goals they have scored across all games played in ewf_matches.\n\n\nEach team has been given a unique ID in the format of T-###-T. This is to enable the tracking of team performance across multiple seasons, as most teams have changed their name over time. For example, Arsenal Ladies became Arsenal Women before the start of the 2017-2018 season, but the same ID is used for them throughout the database (T-001-T). The name of the team in each dataset is the name of the team at the time. Any generic terms such as ‘Football Club’ or ‘F.C.’ have been removed. Reference to ‘Women’ or ‘Ladies’ is included in the team name, where applicable, to indicate changes that have occurred. However, most teams do not explicitly reference ‘Women’ or ‘Ladies’ in their name unless it is to distinguish between the male and female teams.\n\n\n\n# Option 1: tidytuesdayR package \n## install.packages(\"tidytuesdayR\")\n\ntuesdata &lt;- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2024-07-16')\n## OR\ntuesdata &lt;- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2024, week = 29)\n\newf_appearances &lt;- tuesdata$ewf_appearances\newf_matches &lt;- tuesdata$ewf_matches\newf_standings &lt;- tuesdata$ewf_standings\n\n# Option 2: Read directly from GitHub\n\newf_appearances &lt;- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2024/2024-07-16/ewf_appearances.csv')\newf_matches &lt;- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2024/2024-07-16/ewf_matches.csv')\newf_standings &lt;- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2024/2024-07-16/ewf_standings.csv')\n\n\n\n\nExplore the data, watching out for interesting relationships.

According to UN estimates, the data captures around 88% of all objects launched.\n\n\nWhen an object is marked by the source as launched by a country on behalf of another one, the launch is attributed to the latter country.\n\n\nWhen a launch is made jointly by several countries, it is recorded in each of these countries’ time series but only once in the ‘World’ series.\n\nData Page: Annual number of objects launched into space”, part of the following publication: Edouard Mathieu and Max Roser (2022) - “Space Exploration and Satellites”.

The data comes from NASA’s Scientific Visualization Studio.\n\nOn October 14, 2023, an annular solar eclipse [crossed] North, Central, and South America creating a path of annularity. An annular solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between the Sun and Earth while at its farthest point from Earth. Because the Moon is farther away from Earth, it does not completely block the Sun. This create[d] a “ring of fire” effect in the sky for those standing in the path of annularity. On April 8, 2024, a total solar eclipse will cross North and Central America creating a path of totality. During a total solar eclipse, the Moon completely blocks the Sun while it passes between the Sun and Earth. The sky will darken as if it were dawn or dusk and those standing in the path of totality may see the Sun’s outer atmosphere (the corona) if weather permits.\n\nWhich places are in both the 2023 path of annularity and the 2024 path of totality? Which place has the longest duration of totality in 2024?\nNote: The data is an approximation as of 2023-03-08.

The PDFs were read into R using the {pdftools} R package, and explored by TidyTuesday participant Gregory Vander Vinne in a post on his website. Note that stop words (e.g., “and”, “the”, “a”) have been removed from the data.\n\nAs a publicly-traded company, Amazon releases an annual report every year (with a December 31st year end). An annual report is essentially a summary of the company’s performance over the past year. It includes details on how well the company did financially, what goals were achieved, and what challenges it faced.\n\n\nHow have the words used change over time?\nAre there meaningful changes in sentiment from year to year?\nWhich words are likely to appear together in the same annual report?\n\nThank you to Gregory Vander Vinne for curating this week’s dataset.\n\n\n# Using R\n# Option 1: tidytuesdayR R package \n## install.packages(\"tidytuesdayR\")\n\ntuesdata &lt;- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2025-03-25')\n## OR\ntuesdata &lt;- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2025, week = 12)\n\nreport_words_clean &lt;- tuesdata$report_words_clean\n\n# Option 2: Read directly from GitHub\n\nreport_words_clean &lt;- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2025/2025-03-25/report_words_clean.csv')\n# Using Python\n# Option 1: PyDyTuesday python library\n## pip install PyDyTuesday\n\nimport PyDyTuesday\n\n# Download files from the week, which you can then read in locally\nPyDyTuesday.get_date('2025-03-25')\n\n# Option 2: Read directly from GitHub and assign to an object\n\nreport_words_clean = pandas.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2025/2025-03-25/report_words_clean.csv')\n\n\n\n\nExplore the data, watching out for interesting relationships. We would like to emphasize that you should not draw conclusions about causation in the data. There are various moderating variables that affect all data, many of which might not have been captured in these datasets. As such, our suggestion is to use the data provided to practice your data tidying and plotting techniques, and to consider for yourself what nuances might underlie these relationships.\nCreate a visualization, a model, a Quarto report, a shiny app, or some other piece of data-science-related output, using R, Python, or another programming language.\nShare your output and the code used to generate it on social media with the #TidyTuesday hashtag.\nSubmit your own dataset!\n\n\n\n\n\nExploring the TidyTuesday data in Python?

    "text": "This week we’re exploring data on studies investigating racial and ethnic disparities in reproductive medicine as published in the eight highest impact peer-reviewed Ob/Gyn journals from January 1, 2010 through June 30, 2023. The data were collected as part of a review article Racial and ethnic disparities in reproductive medicine in the United States: a narrative review of contemporary high-quality evidence published in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology in January 2025.\n\n“There has been increasing debate around how or if race and ethnicity should be used in medical research—including the conceptualization of race as a biological entity, a social construct, or a proxy for racism. The objectives of this narrative review are to identify and synthesize reported racial and ethnic inequalities in obstetrics and gynecology (ob/gyn) and develop informed recommendations for racial and ethnic inequity research in ob/gyn.”\n\nA companion interactive website was published alongside the review article, and the data has also been used by college students to create data art to raise awareness about this research.\nThe data provides an opportunity to critically examine how racial and ethnic disparities in reproductive medicine are framed, measured, and discussed in the academic literature.\n\nExplore how race and ethnicity are categorized in these articles. Which categories are most prominent? Which are missing? How do sample sizes vary across groups?\nHas the sentiment of article titles, abstracts, keywords, and/or aims statements changed over time?\n\nWhat type of health outcomes have been studied?

    "text": "Thank you for helping us help learners!\nThere are 4 main steps to submit a dataset:\n\nFind a dataset.\nPrepare your repositry.\nCreate a branch.\nPrepare the dataset.\n\n\n\nFind a dataset that would be good for TidyTuesday: either one that is already ready for analysis, or one that you can clean so that it meets the criteria. These are the requirements for a dataset:\n\nData can be saved as one or more CSV files.\nThe whole dataset (all files) is less than 20MB.\nYou can describe each variable (either using an existing data dictionary or by creating your own dictionary).\nThe data is publicly available and free for reuse, either with or without attribution.\n\nYou will also need:\n\nThe source of the dataset\nAn article about the dataset or that uses the dataset\nAt least one image related to or using the dataset\n\n\n\n\nYou’ll need to perform this step the first time you submit a pull request to this repository. A “pull request” is a submission of code to a git repository. If you have never worked with git before, that’s fine! We’ll help you get set up.\n\nSet up git, github, and your IDE (such as RStudio). We have step-by-step instructions for setting up things to work with the Data Science Learning Community.\nFork the tidytuesday repository. In R, you can use usethis::create_from_github(\"rfordatascience/tidytuesday\") to create your personal fork on GitHub and copy it to your computer. Note: This requires about 8 GB of space on disk.\n\n\n\n\nWe use a fork/branch approach to pull requests, meaning you’ll create a version of the repo specifically for your changes, and then ask us to merge those changes into the main tidytuesday repository.\n\nIf you are on anything other than the main branch of your local repository, switch back to main. In R, you can use usethis::pr_pause() (if your previous submission is still pending), or usethis::pr_finish() (if we’ve accepted your submission).\nPull the latest version of the repository to your computer. In R, use usethis::pr_merge_main()\nCreate a new branch, with something similar to the name of the dataset you’re submitting. In R, you can create this branch using usethis::pr_init(BRANCHNAME). For instance if it’s a dataset on American baseball, something like “american-baseball” using usethis::pr_init(\"american-baseball\").\nNavigate to the data/curated folder in your branch of the repository.\nMake a copy of the template folder for your dataset, inside the curated folder. Name it something descriptive – the same name as your branch would work, so “american-baseball” not “my_dataset”.\nInside the folder you just created is where you’re going to do your work.\n\n\n\n\nA copy the following instructions is also available in the folder you’ve created, as instructions.md. These instructions are for preparing a dataset using the R programming language, but we hope to provide instructions for other programming languages eventually.\n\ncleaning.R: Modify the cleaning.R file to get and clean the data.\n\nWrite the code to download and clean the data in cleaning.R.\nIf you’re getting the data from a github repo, remember to use the ‘raw’ version of the URL.\nThis script should result in one or more data.frames, with descriptive variable names (eg players and teams, not df1 and df2).\n\nsaving.R: Usesaving.R to save your datasets. This process creates both the .csv file(s) and the data dictionary template file(s) for your datasets. Don’t save the CSV files using a separate process because we also need the data dictionaries.\n\nRun the first line of saving.R to create the functions we’ll use to save your dataset.\nProvide the name of your directory as dir_name.\nUse ttsave() for each dataset you created in cleaning.R, substituting the name for the dataset for YOUR_DATASET_DF.\n\n{dataset}.md: Edit the {dataset}.md files to describe your datasets (where {dataset} is the name of the dataset). These files are created by saving.R. There should be one file for each of your datasets. You most likely only need to edit the “description” column to provide a description of each variable.\nintro.md: Edit the intro.md file to describe your dataset. You don’t need to add a # Title at the top; this is just a paragraph or two to introduce the week.\nFind at least one image for your dataset. These often come from the article about your dataset. If you can’t find an image, create an example data visualization, and save the images in your folder as png files.\nmeta.yaml: Edit meta.yaml to provide information about your dataset and how we can credit you. You can delete lines from the credit block that do not apply to you.\n\n\n\n\nCommit the changes with this folder to your branch. In RStudio, you can do this on the “Git” tab (the “Commit” button).\nSubmit a pull request to https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday. In R, you can do this with usethis::pr_push(), and then follow the instructions in your browser."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This week we’re exploring text data from Amazon’s annual reports. The PDFs were read into R using the {pdftools} R package, and explored by TidyTuesday participant Gregory Vander Vinne in a post on his website. Note that stop words (e.g., “and”, “the”, “a”) have been removed from the data.\n\nAs a publicly-traded company, Amazon releases an annual report every year (with a December 31st year end). An annual report is essentially a summary of the company’s performance over the past year. It includes details on how well the company did financially, what goals were achieved, and what challenges it faced.\n\n\nHow have the words used change over time?\nAre there meaningful changes in sentiment from year to year?\nWhich words are likely to appear together in the same annual report?\n\nThank you to Gregory Vander Vinne for curating this week’s dataset.\n\n\n# Using R\n# Option 1: tidytuesdayR R package \n## install.packages(\"tidytuesdayR\")\n\ntuesdata &lt;- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2025-03-25')\n## OR\ntuesdata &lt;- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2025, week = 12)\n\nreport_words_clean &lt;- tuesdata$report_words_clean\n\n# Option 2: Read directly from GitHub\n\nreport_words_clean &lt;- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2025/2025-03-25/report_words_clean.csv')\n# Using Python\n# Option 1: PyDyTuesday python library\n## pip install PyDyTuesday\n\nimport PyDyTuesday\n\n# Download files from the week, which you can then read in locally\nPyDyTuesday.get_date('2025-03-25')\n\n# Option 2: Read directly from GitHub and assign to an object\n\nreport_words_clean = pandas.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2025/2025-03-25/report_words_clean.csv')\n\n\n\n\nExplore the data, watching out for interesting relationships. We would like to emphasize that you should not draw conclusions about causation in the data. There are various moderating variables that affect all data, many of which might not have been captured in these datasets. As such, our suggestion is to use the data provided to practice your data tidying and plotting techniques, and to consider for yourself what nuances might underlie these relationships.\nCreate a visualization, a model, a Quarto report, a shiny app, or some other piece of data-science-related output, using R, Python, or another programming language.\nShare your output and the code used to generate it on social media with the #TidyTuesday hashtag.\nSubmit your own dataset!\n\n\n\n\nExploring the TidyTuesday data in Python? Posit has some extra resources for you! Have you tried making a Quarto dashboard? Find videos and other resources in Posit’s PydyTuesday repo.\nShare your work with the world using the hashtags #TidyTuesday and #PydyTuesday so that Posit has the chance to highlight your work, too!\nDeploy or share your work however you want!

    "text": "This week, we are exploring mountaineering data from the Himalayan Dataset!\nThe Himalayan Database is a comprehensive archive documenting mountaineering expeditions in the Nepal Himalaya. It continues the pioneering work of Elizabeth Hawley, a journalist who dedicated much of her life to cataloging climbing history in the region. Her meticulous records were initially compiled from a wide range of sources, including books, alpine journals, and direct correspondence with Himalayan climbers.\nOriginally published in 2004 by the American Alpine Club as a CD-ROM booklet, the Himalayan Database became a critical resource for the climbing community. In 2017, a non-profit organization named The Himalayan Database was formed to continue Hawley’s legacy. This marked the release of Version 2 of the database, now freely available for download via the internet.\nThese data are rich in historical value, detailing the peaks, expeditions, climbing statuses, and geographic information of numerous Himalayan summits. We will explore these data in two tidy tibbles, making it easier to analyze trends in mountaineering expeditions, including seasonality, success rates, and national participation over time. Participants this week will be able to use the peaks and expeditions datasets. To manage file size, the expeditions file was filtered down to 2020-2024.\n\nWhat is the distribution of climbing status (PSTATUS) across different mountain ranges (HIMAL_FACTOR)?\nWhich mountain range (HIMAL_FACTOR) has the highest average peak height (HEIGHTM)?\nWhat is the distribution of peak heights (HEIGHTM) for peaks that are open (OPEN) versus those that are not?\nWhich climbing routes (ROUTE1, ROUTE2, ROUTE3, ROUTE4) have the highest success rates (SUCCESS1, SUCCESS2, SUCCESS3, SUCCESS4) across all expeditions?\nHow does the use of supplemental oxygen (O2USED, O2NONE) affect summit success rates?\nHow often does bad weather (TERMREASON = 4) play a role in termination compared to technical difficulty (TERMREASON = 10)?\nAre expeditions with no hired personnel (NOHIRED) associated with higher or lower death rates?\n\nThank you to Nicolas Foss, Ed.D., MS for curating this week’s dataset.\n\n\n# Option 1: tidytuesdayR package \n## install.packages(\"tidytuesdayR\")\n\ntuesdata &lt;- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2025-01-21')\n## OR\ntuesdata &lt;- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2025, week = 3)\n\nexped_tidy &lt;- tuesdata$exped_tidy\npeaks_tidy &lt;- tuesdata$peaks_tidy\n\n# Option 2: Read directly from GitHub\n\nexped_tidy &lt;- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2025/2025-01-21/exped_tidy.csv')\npeaks_tidy &lt;- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2025/2025-01-21/peaks_tidy.csv')\n\n\n\n\nExplore the data, watching out for interesting relationships.

Please note that episodes and script lines have been filtered to only include episodes from 2010 to 2016 in the episodes data to keep file size within GitHub limits!\nHere is some history on the Simpsons Dataset from the author:\n\nOriginally, this dataset was scraped by [Todd W. Schneider] for his post The Simpsons by the Data, for which he made the scraper available on GitHub. Kaggle user William Cukierski used the scraper to upload the data set, which has been rehosted here.\n\n\nWhich character has the most spoken lines across all episodes, and how has their dialogue volume changed over the seasons?\nWhat are the most frequently used locations in the series, and do specific locations correspond to higher IMDb ratings for episodes?\nIs there a relationship between the number of U.S. viewers (in millions) and the IMDb ratings or votes for episodes?\nWhat are the most commonly used words or phrases in the dialogue across the series, and do they differ by character or location?\n\nThank you to Nicolas Foss, Ed.D., MS with Iowa HHS for curating this week’s dataset.\n\n\n# Option 1: tidytuesdayR package \n## install.packages(\"tidytuesdayR\")\n\ntuesdata &lt;- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2025-02-04')\n## OR\ntuesdata &lt;- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2025, week = 5)\n\nsimpsons_characters &lt;- tuesdata$simpsons_characters\nsimpsons_episodes &lt;- tuesdata$simpsons_episodes\nsimpsons_locations &lt;- tuesdata$simpsons_locations\nsimpsons_script_lines &lt;- tuesdata$simpsons_script_lines\n\n# Option 2: Read directly from GitHub\n\nsimpsons_characters &lt;- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2025/2025-02-04/simpsons_characters.csv')\nsimpsons_episodes &lt;- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2025/2025-02-04/simpsons_episodes.csv')\nsimpsons_locations &lt;- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2025/2025-02-04/simpsons_locations.csv')\nsimpsons_script_lines &lt;- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2025/2025-02-04/simpsons_script_lines.csv')\n\n\n\n\nExplore the data, watching out for interesting relationships.

    "text": "This week we’re exploring data from the FBI Crime Data API! Specifically, we’re looking at agency-level data across all 50 states in the USA. This dataset provides details on law enforcement agencies that have submitted data to the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program and are displayed on the Crime Data Explorer (CDE).\n\nCurrently, the FBI produces four annual publications from data provided by more than 18,000 federal, state, county, city, university and college, and tribal law enforcement agencies voluntarily participating in the UCR program.\nCrime data is dynamic. Offenses occur, arrests are made, and property is recovered every day. The FBI’s Crime Data Explorer, the digital front door for UCR data, is an attempt to reflect that fluidity in crime. The data presented there is updated regularly in a way that UCR publications previously could not be. Launched in 2017, the CDE’s content and features are updated and expanded continuously. CDE enables law enforcement agencies, researchers, journalists, and the public to more easily use and understand the massive amounts of UCR data using charts and graphs.\n\n\nHow do agency types vary? How are agencies distributed geographically within each state?\nWhat percentage of agencies in each state participate in NIBRS reporting? Are there any trends in NIBRS adoption?\n\nThank you to Ford Johnson for curating this week’s dataset.\n\n\n# Using R\n# Option 1: tidytuesdayR R package\n## install.packages(\"tidytuesdayR\")\n\ntuesdata &lt;- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2025-02-18')\n## OR\ntuesdata &lt;- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2025, week = 7)\n\nagencies &lt;- tuesdata$agencies\n\n# Option 2: Read directly from GitHub\n\nagencies &lt;- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2025/2025-02-18/agencies.csv')\n# Using Python\n# Option 1: PyDyTuesday python library\n## pip install PyDyTuesday\n\nimport PyDyTuesday\n\n# Download files from the week, which you can then read in locally\nPyDyTuesday.get_date(\"2025-02-18\")\n\n# Option 2: Read directly from GitHub and assign to an object\n\nagencies = pandas.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2025/2025-02-18/agencies.csv')\n\n\n\n\nExplore the data, watching out for interesting relationships.

That’s more likely to be correct this time of year than in the Fall!\nThe dataset this week comes from Statistics Canada, the NHL team list endpoint, and the NHL API. The dataset was inspired by the blog Are Birth Dates Still Destiny for Canadian NHL Players? by JLaw (via https://universeodon.com/@jlaw/111522860812359901)!\n\nIn the first chapter Malcolm Gladwell’s Outliers he discusses how in Canadian Junior Hockey there is a higher likelihood for players to be born in the first quarter of the year.\n\n\nBecause these kids are older within their year they make all the important teams at a young age which gets them better resources for skill development and so on.\n\n\nWhile it seems clear that more players are born in the first few months of the year, what isn’t explored is whether or not this would be expected. Maybe more people in Canada in general are born earlier in the year.\n\n\nI will explore whether Gladwell’s result is expected as well as whether this is still true in today’s NHL for Canadian-born players.\n\nCan you reproduce JLaw’s results?

    "text": "This week’s data is Trash Wheel Collection Data from the Mr. Trash Wheel Baltimore Healthy Harbor initiative.\n\nMr. Trash Wheel is a semi-autonomous trash interceptor that is placed at the end of a river, stream or other outfall. Far too lazy to chase trash around the ocean, Mr. Trash Wheel stays put and waits for the waste to flow to him. Sustainably powered and built to withstand the biggest storms, Mr. Trash Wheel uses a unique blend of solar and hydro power to pull hundreds of tons of trash out of the water each year.\n\nThe Healthy Harbor initiative has four Trash Wheels collecting trash. Mr. Trash Wheel was the first to start, and since then three more have joined the family. The Trash Wheel Family has collected more than 2,362 tons of trash. See more about how Mr. Trash Wheel works.\n\nData collection methodology\n\n\n\nWhen crew members are on the machine during the time when a dumpster is being filled, they will manually count the number of each of the item types listed on a single conveyor paddle. This process is repeated several times during the dumpster filling process. An average is then calculated for number of each item per paddle. The average is then multiplied by the paddle rate and then by the elapsed time to fill the dumpster.\n\n\n\nExample: * Paddle #1- 9 plastic bottles * Paddle #2- 14 plastic bottles * Paddle #3- 5 plastic bottles * Paddle #4- 12 plastic bottles * Average = 10 plastic bottles/paddle\n\n\nConveyor speed = 2.5 paddles per minute therefore an average of 25 plastic bottles are loaded each minute. If it takes 100 minutes to fill the dumpster, we estimate that there are 2,500 bottles in that dumpster.\n\n\n\nIf no crew is present during the loading, we will take random bushel size samples of the collected material and count items in these samples. A full dumpster contains approximately 325 bushels. Therefore, if an average bushel sample from a dumpster contains 3 polystyrene containers, we estimate that the dumpster contains 975 polystyrene containers.\n\n\n\n\nPeriodically “dumpster dives” are held where volunteers count everything in an entire dumpster. These events help validate our sampling methods and also look at what materials are dumpster. present that are not included in our sampling categories.\n\n\nWhat type of trash is collected the most? Do the different Trash Wheels collect different sets of trash? Are there times of the year when more or less trash is collected?\n\n\n# Option 1: tidytuesdayR package \n## install.packages(\"tidytuesdayR\")\n\ntuesdata &lt;- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2024-03-05')\n## OR\ntuesdata &lt;- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2024, week = 10)\n\ntrashwheel &lt;- tuesdata$trashwheel\n\n\n# Option 2: Read directly from GitHub\n\ntrashwheel &lt;- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2024/2024-03-05/trashwheel.csv')\n\n\n\n\nExplore the data, watching out for interesting relationships.

The idea is that the the concepts in Michael Lewis’ book Moneyball, can be applied in a number of cultural industries, not just baseball like in the book and the movie.\n\nIt’s no accident that the name of this piece is Mutant Moneyball, as the overall point is an exercise in valuing each individual character on the X-Men team in a variety of data driven ways. But buying, reading, and loving comic books should be purely for fun and the raw expression of devotion toward characters, art, and story. True: It’s a lesson we fans have failed to learn in the past. The trend of buying comics based on value speculation crippled the entire comic book industry for over a decade in the late 1990’s and early 2000’s. And the point of this isn’t to repeat those mistakes, it’s to gamify open and available financial data, giving us special insight, once unattainable, regarding our magnificent mutants. Like mature adults.\n\n\nWhy are some characters sought after more than others, what stories did some mighty mutants convey that made them sought after, while others that eek out a continued existence are unable to resonate enough with a fan base to garner the same kind of love and appreciation in the secondary market? Are there answers that a close reading of value data can offer?\n\nDollar signs and percentage signs are in the data for some of the columns. Which columns are they in?

I scraped this data from www.sports-reference.com in May 2018.\nNote that the Winter and Summer Games were held in the same year up until 1992. After that, they staggered them such that Winter Games occur on a four year cycle starting with 1994, then Summer in 1996, then Winter in 1998, and so on. A common mistake people make when analyzing this data is to assume that the Summer and Winter Games have always been staggered.\n\n\nThe Olympic data on www.sports-reference.com is the result of an incredible amount of research by a group of Olympic history enthusiasts and self-proclaimed ‘statistorians’. Check out their blog for more information.

The scraping functions and cleaning code for 2017 - 2024 encounters can be found in the {orcas} R package.\nThe dataset is mostly tidy but not completely clean. There are still missing values and typos, as evident from some encounters having a negative duration.\n\nAn Encounter refers to any time we observe killer whales (orcas), from one of CWR’s research boats or land, where at least one individual is identified and photographed. Typically, 2-4 staff are involved in an encounter. Once we come into contact with whales (ie. within distance of identifying individuals by sight) we have begun our encounter. During an encounter, our main goal is to photograph every individual present from both the left and right side.\n\nWhich pods or ecotypes have the longest duration encounters with CWR researchers?

It includes data on perfume ratings, olfactory notes (top, middle, and base notes), perfumers, year of release and other relevant characteristics of the perfumes listed on the Parfumo website.\n\n\nThe data provides a comprehensive look at how various perfumes are rated, which families of scents they belong to, and detailed breakdowns of the key olfactory components that define their overall profile\n\nWe’ll explore how perfumes are rated, uncover the scent families they belong to, and delve into the minds of the perfumers behind them. From the year of release to the delicate composition of each scent, this dataset offers a rich olfactory experience for anyone curious about the magic behind their favorite perfumes.\nJoin us as we decode the stories within these perfumes, from the top notes that hit you first to the lasting base notes that linger in the air. Whether you’re a fragrance aficionado or just curious about the data behind the scents, this exploration will open your eyes (and nose) to the artistry of perfume crafting.

We found the data via the article “Global holiday datasets for understanding seasonal human mobility and population dynamics” by Shengjie Lai (et al) (thank you to @lgibson7 for finding the dataset).\n\nPublic and school holidays have important impacts on population mobility and dynamics across multiple spatial and temporal scales, subsequently affecting the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases and many socioeconomic activities. However, worldwide data on public and school holidays for understanding their changes across regions and years have not been assembled into a single, open-source and multitemporal dataset. To address this gap, an open access archive of data on public and school holidays in 2010–2019 across the globe at daily, weekly, and monthly timescales was constructed. Airline passenger volumes across 90 countries from 2010 to 2018 were also assembled to illustrate the usage of the holiday data for understanding the changing spatiotemporal patterns of population movements.\n\nSources:\nLai S., Sorichetta A. and WorldPop (2020).
